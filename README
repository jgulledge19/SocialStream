SocialStream for MODX Revolution

Orginally created June 2011

This extra can pull in streams from many different accounts and save them to a DB.
You can then customize the output.  It is also easy to extend to add other streams.

At this moment I don't plan to package and release in the MODX Extras, but you would 
be more then welcome to do so.
